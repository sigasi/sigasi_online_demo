# Sigasi Online Demo Project

This is the Demo Project that loads in [Sigasi Online].

The Demo Project showcases the features available in the online version of Sigasi Studio.
It is a very simple mixed language project.
To start the demo project, open `step_1_welcome.vhd` and follow the **TODO** comments to walk through the examples.

If you wish to see a larger project in action, you can go to the Command Pallete (**Ctrl+Shift+P**) and type **Sigasi: Create Demo Project**.
Doing so will open a new browser tab with a project for a [RISC-V Core].
